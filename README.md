# findIP.sh

Resolve a list of sub-domains to their first IPv4 address and save the results to `iplist.txt`.

## ðŸ“‘ What this script does
1. **Validates input** â€“ Requires a text file containing sub-domain (or URL) per line.  
2. **Cleans the domain** â€“ Strips any leading `http://` or `https://`.  
3. **Performs DNS look-ups** â€“ Uses `dig` to grab the first A record (IPv4).  
4. **Stores the output** â€“ Writes every successfully-resolved IP to `iplist.txt`.
